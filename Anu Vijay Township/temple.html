      <p><b>Raja Rajeswari Amman Temple</b></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Raja Rajeswari means the the lord of the lords, or the king of kings. In
      Hinduism, she is one of the highest aspects of Shakti or Parvathi, the
      consort of Shiva. Since she is the ruler of the universe, the name, Raja
      Rajeswari, aptly fits her. In the Lalitha Sahsranamam she is mentioned as
      an aspect of Sri Lalitha Tripura Sundari. In the following sthavam (a poem
      of praise) addressed to her, she is extolled by many names and described
      as eternally youthful, auspicious, the wealth of empires, ruler of the
      rulers, and the slayer of Dhumraakhsa, an asura. In the images she is
      generally depcited as a beautiful and youthful godess, sitting on a golden
      throne, holding in her four hands an ankusa (a sharp object to control
      elephants), a pasa ( a rope denoting bondage), a sugarcane stalk, and a
      lotus. The last one also is held in the gestire of abhaya (assurance).
      Devotees believe that when she is pleased by devotion, she grants power,
      authority, rulership, and wealth to her devotees and protects them from
      enemies.

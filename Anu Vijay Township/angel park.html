      A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for
      human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or
      natural habitats. Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation
      inside towns and cities. National parks and country parks are green spaces
      used for recreation in the countryside. State parks and provincial parks
      are administered by sub-national government states and agencies. Parks may
      consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain
      buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground
      structures. Many parks have fields for playing sports such as baseball and
      football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have
      trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built
      adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or
      boat dock area. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain
      picnic tables and barbecue grills.<br />

        A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose
        particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock,
        such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources,
        such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different
        densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and
        weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of
        material.

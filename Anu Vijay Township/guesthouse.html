      In some areas of the world, guest houses are the only kind of
      accommodation available for visitors who have no local relatives to stay
      with. Among the features which distinguish a guest house from a hotel, or
      inn is the lack of a full-time staff. Bed and breakfasts and guest houses
      in England are family owned and the family lives on the premises though
      family members are not normally available during the evening. However,
      most family members work a 10- to 12-hour day from 6 am as they may employ
      part-time service staff. Hotels maintain a staff presence 24 hours a day
      and 7 days a week, whereas a guest house has a more limited staff
      presence. Because of limited staff presence, check-in at a guest house is
      often by appointment. An inn also usually has a restaurant attached.

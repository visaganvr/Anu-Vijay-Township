      A swimming pool, swimming bath, wading pool, paddling pool, or simply
      pool, is a structure designed to hold water to enable swimming or other
      leisure activities. Pools can be built into the ground (in-ground pools)
      or built above ground (as a freestanding construction or as part of a
      building or other larger structure), and may be found as a feature aboard
      ocean-liners and cruise ships. In-ground pools are most commonly
      constructed from materials such as concrete, natural stone, metal,
      plastic,composite or fiberglass, and can be of a custom size and shape or
      built to a standardized size, the largest of which is the Olympic-size
      swimming pool.<br />
